				<p class="p-feature">
					A visa is a conditional authorization given by a competent authority of a country for a person who is not a citizen of that country to enter its territory and to remain there for a limited duration. Each country typically attaches various conditions to their visas, such as duration of stay, the territory covered by the visa, dates of validity, whether the visa is valid for more than one visit, etc. Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a country, and are thus, for some countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country.
				</p>
				<p class="p-feature">
					The visa is commonly a stamp endorsed in the applicant's passport or other travel document. The visa, when required, was historically granted by an immigration official on a visitor's arrival at the frontiers of a country, but increasingly today a traveller wishing to enter another country must apply in advance for a visa, sometimes in person at a consular office, by mail or over the internet.

				<div class="boxes">
					<h2>Immigration Control</h2>
					<p>
						With concerns like terrorism, overpopulation and economics, it is imperative for any nation to monitor who enters the country. A visa allows a central government to control how many foreign visitors can enter, how long they are allowed to stay and the activities they are allowed to participate in, such as tourism or work.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxes">
					<h2>Identity Verification</h2>
					<p>
						The visa application process allows a nation's consular and immigration departments to verify the identity of the traveler prior to his arrival. The traveler's criminal and economic backgrounds are usually investigated, as well as whether or not he carries any communicable diseases. If the consular department determines the traveler does not pass the stringent background test, it reserves the right to refuse entry before the traveler even lands on their soil.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxes">
					<h2>Visa On Arrival</h2>
					<p>
						Visa on arrival (VOA) means that on arrival, you will need to queue up at a visa counter, apply and pay for a visa, which gets pasted into your passport on the spot, before you go to immigration. VOA is often limited to certain entry points (eg. international airports, major land borders), so for border crossings where it's not available, you will need to apply for a regular visa in advance.
